          Hello! I’m Subhendu Sekhar Sahu, a passionate and detail-oriented
          frontend developer with a drive to create visually engaging,
          user-friendly digital experiences. With a deep understanding of HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in translating complex ideas into
          responsive, intuitive interfaces that not only look great but feel
          seamless to interact with. I take pride in crafting clean, efficient
          code and bringing modern web designs to life—whether it’s a sleek
          landing page, an interactive form, or a dynamic web application.
          <br />
          Beyond code, I’m deeply committed to staying up-to-date with the
          latest web trends and technologies. I regularly challenge myself by
          working on creative projects that stretch my skills and encourage
          innovative thinking. I strive to write code that is both accessible
          and maintainable, and I value collaboration and thoughtful feedback as
          essential parts of the development process. As I continue to grow in
          this field, my goal is to contribute to projects that matter—solutions
          that are practical, elegant, and impactful. Whether I’m building a
          personal project or contributing to a larger team, I bring passion,
          precision, and a positive mindset to everything I do. I’m excited to
          connect with like-minded creators, developers, and designers as I
          continue evolving in this ever-changing digital world.
